## 👋 Hey there! I'm **Khaled Mustafa Eltazy**

I’m an **Android & Multiplatform Developer** who loves building **clean, scalable, and user-friendly apps** using **Kotlin** and **Compose Multiplatform**.  
I’ve developed several applications completely from scratch — blending **solid architecture**, **modern design**, and a deep focus on **smooth user experience**.  

One of my apps is already **live on Google Play**, proving my ability to take projects from concept to production.  
Right now, I’m focused on building **high-quality Android apps** with **Jetpack Compose** and exploring the full potential of **Compose Multiplatform (CMP/KMP)** for cross-platform development.
